  <div class="entry-content"><p>How do you know when to look for another job? As times shift from careers at one employer spanning decades, this is a question that more and more people ask themselves. In the startup world that Rails oftentimes lives in, it can be a frequent riddle. As with any riddle, it&#8217;s all about the clues.</p>

<h3>Clues That You Should Start Looking</h3>

<ul>
<li>Technologically, you lag behind the community

<ul>
<li>Rails &lt; 3.2.x</li>
<li>Continual use of gems long since outdated/outperformed by newer entrants due to benefits being unclear or devalued by the non-technical</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No Learning Opportunities

<ul>
<li><strong>ABL</strong> - <strong><em>a</em></strong>lways <strong><em>b</em></strong>e <strong><em>l</em></strong>earning. There is no future proofing yourself and the development world short of keeping yourself up to date</li>
<li>If you find yourself thinking that you know all there is to know about your app and nothing challenges you, it might be time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Poor Management

<ul>
<li>Bad habits are hard to break, don&#8217;t pick them up working at a place that doens&#8217;t employ best practices - <em>especially</em> if you&#8217;re a junior dev</li>
<li>If management always forces you to do hack jobs, you&#8217;ll end up being very skilled&#8230;at hack jobs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>The worst disservice you can do as a Rails developer is to ignore these signs. Doing so might leave you not capable to compete for the jobs you want (right now, you can definitely find a Rails job &#8211; it just might not be the one you want but the one you <em>deserve</em>).</p>

<p>I wish I was speaking from second-hand knowledge, but I know these things because I found myself laid off in the economic downturn in 2008. I had joined in &#8216;06 and over the course of the next couple years, I became very comfortable with the application I was working; not pushing myself to learn more. I disregarded how our overall workflow was built on best practices in the Rails world from early 2007 and not the shifting tides. In short, I found myself not being able to discuss from a position of experience things that companies wanted from a Rails developer. <strong><em>This is not an enviable position</em></strong></p>

<p>I had fallen into a comfort zone in the <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Up-or-Out-Solving-the-IT-Turnover-Crisis.aspx">Dead Sea</a>; not learning or pushing myslf as a developer. <span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Being laid off was the best thing that could have happened to me.'> Being laid off was the best thing that could have happened to me.</span> It was a wake up call that technology can and will move without you. This uncertainty is exciting and I&#8217;ve come to revel in making the unknown known.</p>

<p>As a result, I&#8217;ve grown more as a developer. Sometimes that&#8217;s simply taking a pivotal story that pushes you. Sometimes, that&#8217;s taking on a small side project. Sometimes, that&#8217;s recognizing when to take a new opportunity.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it&#8217;s simply <em>time</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about gender lately. I&#8217;ve been a full time developer since 2006; working on 5 different teams but it wasn&#8217;t until September 2010 that I had worked with a female developer. In the past, these male dominated teams suffered at times with debates that really amounted to people speaking past each other at increasing volumes. Innovation suffers in places like these and I can say that was certainly the case.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;ve noticed a push for females to have avenues to get involved in web development. This has manifested itself in women specific ruby groups, <a href="http://coderdojonyc.com/2013/01/02/girls-hack-day-january-27th-2012/">workshops that are women only</a>, and an overall desire if not necessity to have female speakers at conferences.</p>

<p>In the case of the britruby conference, a backlash over an all white male speaker list took place and with the possibility of sponsors bailing, the conference was <a href="https://gist.github.com/4106776" title="Unofficial Statement">cancelled</a>. The <a href="http://bostinno.com/2012/03/20/boston-api-jam-publishes-eventbrite-with-sexist-language-enrages-community-sponsors-quick-to-pull-out/">Boston API Jam</a> took heat; what with their &#8220;friendly female&#8221; event staff capable of getting you another beer. Sponsorship was pulled by Heroku and Apigee as a result.</p>

<h3>Heroku&#8217;s Response Tweet</h3>

<blockquote><p>Investigating Boston API Jam fiasco. Our sponsorships are handled by women and we do take this issue seriously.</p></blockquote>

<p><code>I find it odd that they have to point out that their sponsorships are handled by women. I would like to think that men would also be capable of taking the issue seriously.</code></p>

<p>Meanwhile, some developers are growing tired of the intense push for equality (both gender and ethnic diversity). Recently, I saw a website quiz (link escapes me) to test if your conference meets diversity requirements. If you fail to answer positively to any of these, you are labeled a misogynist and other terms no one ever wants to be associated with.</p>

<p>As technology has become even more important, it&#8217;s surprising to see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_computing#In_the_workforce">decline</a> in the percentage of women working in it. I recognize that there is an inherent problem when any industry is dominated by a &#8220;boys&#8217; club&#8221; which makes it unfriendly to females or ethnic groups different than the one that permeates within. I do wonder though if this boys&#8217; club problem didn&#8217;t exist, would we achieve a balance equivalent to the population ratio?</p>

<p>One thing is for certain, if we as an industry do reach that sort of balance, <a href="http://blog.jessitron.com/2012/09/this-is-not-ok.html" title="women need bathrooms too">this</a> can&#8217;t happen.</p>
